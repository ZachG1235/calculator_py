# python_calculator 
## Overview 
This python program, once run, creates a window on the user's machine that has a calculator! This interface includes buttons to allow easy operation of the calculator, where it will then display a result in the interface.

#### Why? 
Honestly, with my last semester coming up for college, I wanted to code some more "fun" things. This was mainly a test to help myself get more aquainted with actual UI. I also really wanted to code something in python again, so I had a lot of fun with this!

## Technologies Used 
1. Python 3.11.4

2. Tkinter Package 

That's all! :) 

## How to Run? 
1. Download and Install Python3 if you haven't already.  

2. Download `calculator.py` 

3. Run the file by either double-clicking it directly or entering into your terminal 

```bash
# make sure you're in the same directory
python calculator.py 
```
```bash
# or try...
python3 calculator.py
```
